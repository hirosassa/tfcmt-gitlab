#     Fork of shunsuke-suzuki/tfcmt. tfcmt-gitlab is a GitLab supported version of tfcmt.
#   license: MIT

#   # Setting this will prevent goreleaser to actually try to commit the updated
#   # formula - instead, the formula file will be stored on the dist folder only,
#   # leaving the responsibility of publishing it to the user.
#   # If set to auto, the release will not be uploaded to the homebrew tap
#   # in case there is an indicator for prerelease in the tag e.g. v1.0.0-rc1
#   # Default is false.
#   skip_upload: auto

#   # So you can `brew test` your formula.
#   # Default is empty.
